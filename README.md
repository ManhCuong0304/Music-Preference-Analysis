# Data Analysis Project: Vietnamese Music Preference from 2018 to 2024
## Introduction
A new talent music artist wants to determine whether their music genre appeals to Vietnamese listeners and identify suitable, well-known artists within the same genre for collaboration on their debut album. The Analysis Project will help that artist to understand the overall listener demographic, the best candidate to invite for the collaboration, what platform that the artist's song would perform the best.
## Project Objectives: 
1. Analyze Vietnamese music preferences, including genre distribution and the influence of foreign versus local music.
2. Identify the most dominant artists based on their appearances in the charts across all available platforms.
3. Determine the songs that have held the first position multiple times.
4. Identify potential artists for collaboration, and the best platform to release the song.
## Tools that were used in analysis
1. Python/Visual Studio Code: To get the scripts for collecting raw data.
2. Excel: To store and organize the data.
3. Power BI: To create visualizations for the analysis.
## Skills
1. Knowing how websites are built to scrape data effectively.
2. Writing good prompts to generate the right scripts.
3. Cleaning data and solving problems along the way.
4. Creating clear and impactful visualizations.
5. Making decisions to match requirements based on data.

### a.1.2. Overall Analysis

-Overall, on the Apple Music platform, Vietnamese listeners have gradually shifted their preference from US-UK pop to V-pop. As a result, music by Vietnamese artists has appeared more frequently in the Weekly Rank Chart since 2021.

-Taylor Swift is the most relevant artist in the chart with 1035 appearances. Despite being a foreign artist in the Vietnamese preference chart and the overall decline in demand for US-UK pop, her songs still hold strong replay value.

-tlinh is the most relevant featured artist in the chart, with songs featuring her appearing 350 times in the weekly most-listened songs chart.

-The song that stayed in the Top 100 the longest is **Lối Nhỏ** by Đen. It remained in the weekly chart for the entire years of 2021 and 2022, missing only one week in 2021 and 2023. However, in the latest year, it only stayed for 35 weeks.

### a.2.2. Analysis

-The genre preferences of the top songs were quite diverse in 2021, but by 2024, only three genres dominated the competition for the top spots: V-pop, Pop, and K-pop.

-The gap between Vietnamese and foreign artists in securing the No.1 spot has narrowed, shifting from Vietnamese songs holding the top position 41 times versus foreign songs 11 times in 2022 to a closer 31-21 split in 2024.

-Sơn Tùng M-TP is undoubtedly the "King of V-pop" as he is the Most Dominant Artist on this platform, reaching the First position 26 times. He achieved this with seven different songs, with **Chúng ta của hiện tại** and **Đừng làm trái tim anh đau** being the two biggest hits, each reaching No.1 seven times. Additionally, Chúng ta của hiện tại stayed relevant for 194 weeks.

-itsnk is the Most Dominant Featured Artist, with two songs reaching the number 1 spot, one of which held the position 15 times.

-Even though Sơn Tùng has multiple hits, the Most Dominant Song does not belong to him. **Từng Quen** by Wren Evans holds this title, ranking 1st for 15 weeks—an impressive feat for a young artist like him. Perhaps because of this success, both he and tlinh secured collaborations with Apple: "[Cứu lấy âm nhạc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K6PRfAp6O4)" and "[đừng làm nó phức tạp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2oCfQ5QOIk)".  It seems that Apple wanted to position itself as a young and energetic brand, as they actively promoted these two music videos. The Like-to-View ratio for Wren's song is only 0.11%, indicating that while the video was not highly engaging, it was seen by a large audience through advertising.

_-To identify the perfect candidate for collaboration, an individual analysis is required. Among the top five artists in the Most Dominant Artists chart, three stand out as potential candidates. Sơn Tùng M-TP is primarily known for his solo songs, with his only collaboration being with a foreign artist, while Mono has had just one song reach the top. Therefore, Wren Evans, tlinh, and Đen have been selected for individual analysis._

### b.3. Individual Analysis

### b.3.1 Wren Evans

-From Visualization 1, although Wren Evans has multiple songs categorized as featuring songs, his main collaborator, itsnk, is a producer. The only true artist who contributed a verse was Evy, but that song did not achieve the same level of success as the others. From Visualization 2, Wren Evans' performance as a collaborator was decent. However, compared to other candidates, he struggled to compete.

### b.3.2 Đen

-When Đen is the main artist, he has introduced many talented artists like Biên, Nguyên Thảo, Ngọc Linh, and the latest young singer, Pia Linh, to the audience. On the other hand, the songs he was featured in were by well-known artists. Đen could be a great artist to collaborate with, as he helps boost the recognition of new artists. However, he seems to prioritize singers who excel in pop to balance the structure of his songs, given that he is a rapper.

### b.3.3 tlinh

-tlinh is the best candidate to be invited as a collaborator. She excels in her solo songs (with 215 weeks on the chart), in songs featuring a producer (2Pillz, with 124 weeks on the chart), and even more impressively, in songs where other artists featured her (132, 87, and 64 weeks on the chart from three different songs and artists, respectively).

### 2. Spotify

### a.1.2 Analysis

-Overall, the data from Spotify is relatively similar to Apple Music. V-pop songs have gradually replaced US-UK pop songs in the 2024 weekly charts. Additionally, local hip-hop has gained traction among Spotify listeners, becoming the second most popular genre for the Vietnamese audience. As a result, Vietnamese songs appeared a total of 8915 times in Spotify’s most-listened weekly charts in 2024, a significant increase from just 2051 appearances in 2018, highlighting the growing demand for Vietnamese music each year.

-BTS is the most relevant artist or in this case, the most dominant band with their songs appearing in the weekly chart a total of 3046 times. Notably, 2020 was their peak year, with 738 appearances over 53 weeks. This means that, on average, 14 out of the 200 songs on the chart each week belonged to BTS.

-Duongg is the featured artists with the most appearances on Spotify, with 607 times.

-"Lạ Lùng" by Vũ. is the song that stayed in the chart the longest with 351 consecutive week appearances.

### a.2.2 Analysis

-Even though the overall data shows that the preference for K-pop has declined since 2022, the Rank 1 data highlights its dominance, with K-pop holding the top spot for 46 out of 52 weeks in 2024.

-Aside from Korean artists, many foreign artists also held the No. 1 spot for several weeks. These findings suggest that while the overall preference is shifting toward local music, Vietnamese songs still face significant challenges in reaching the top.

-Artists from Korea dominated the weekly first position, especially BTS and the group members (Jung Kook and Jimin). Even the "King of V-pop" struggled to overtake the first position from that idol band. There is a hypothesis that the fans of this band were dedicated enough to consistently "farm stream counts." This hypothesis will be discussed in the **Bonus section**. 

-The most dominant featured artist is Latto, with 43 appearances across two versions of the same Jung Kook song.

-The most dominant song is Seven (explicit version) with 27 times at the top position, followed by Seven (normal version) in second place with 16 times. It wasn’t until the sixth position that a Vietnamese song appeared, Chúng ta của hiện tại by Sơn Tùng, with 12 times at number one. The top 10 most dominant songs consisted of 8 K-pop tracks, highlighting the intense competition for the top weekly song on the Spotify platform.

-To identify the perfect candidate for collaboration, an individual analysis is required. Since inviting foreign artists for collaboration is unrealistic for a new artist, foreign artist data was filtered out. The final top five were Sơn Tùng M-TP, Đen, Da LAB, Mỹ Tâm, and Vũ. Among these five, Sơn Tùng was not a good fit for collaboration, as previously discussed. Despite being repetitive, Đen was selected again because he is the second most successful Vietnamese artist on Spotify. Da LAB was chosen because the band had a song that reached the top position five times and remained relevant for 329 weeks. Vũ was selected as the final candidate for individual analysis due to having a song that appeared in nearly every weekly chart since its release. Additionally, he has featured in many collaborations, unlike Mỹ Tâm, who primarily focuses on solo projects.

### b.3. Individual Analysis

### b.3.1 Đen

-Đen's performance as the main artist is relatively similar to Apple Music. However, when he is featured in other artists' songs, his performance is better on this platform in terms of the songs' relevance and the variety of artists he collaborates with. He is one of the best artist for the collaboration.

### b.3.2 Da LAB

-Da LAB, as a band, excels in their solo tracks. When featuring other artists, they typically collaborate with established names, with Juky San being the only emerging artist they have worked with. Their performance as featured artists was solid but not outstanding, as they are often featured alongside their member Emcee L in his solo projects.

### b.3.3 Vũ

-Vũ's solo tracks are phenomenal in terms of relevancy. He collaborates with both well-known artists like Hà Anh Tuấn, Binz, and Low G, as well as emerging talents like TRANG and Mạc Mai Sương. As a featured artist, he played a significant role in boosting Madihu's career with the song Vì Anh Đâu Có Biết from Madihu’s debut album.

### 3. Zing MP3

### a.1. Overall Analysis Visualization

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190d4d16-858c-43ee-a1e7-4e0c50bb4144)

### a.1. Overall Analysis

-Since foreign songs have a separate chart, the genre data consists only of Vietnamese genres, with V-pop once again being the most popular. Songs on this platform do not remain on the chart for long, as Zing MP3’s weekly chart only features 40 songs, leading to lower total appearances. The most dominant artist on Zing MP3 is Jack-J97, who held the top position 26 times, , while the most dominant song is Cắt đôi nỗi sầu by Tăng Duy Tân, which reached No. 1 a total of 12 times. The listener demographics on this platform differ significantly from the other two, as the top artists and songs contrast sharply with those on Apple Music and Spotify. Notably, artists like Hương Ly, Lê Bảo Bình, and Châu Khải Phong, who dominate Zing MP3, are relatively unfamiliar in mainstream media.
