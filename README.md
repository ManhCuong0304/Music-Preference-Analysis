-Overall, in Apple Music platform, Vietnamese listeners had gradually shifted their preference from USUK pop to V-pop, because of that the music made by Vietnamese artists were showing up more in the Weekly Rank Chart since 2021.

-Sơn Tùng M-TP is undoubtly the "King of V-pop", because he is the Most Dominant Artist in this platform with 26 times in the First position, he achieved the First position with 7 different songs, "Chúng ta của hiện tại" and "Đừng làm trái tim anh đau" were the 2 hits with 7 times in the No.1 song, and "Chúng ta của hiện tại" also stayed relevant for 194 weeks.

-Even though having multiple hits, the Most Dominant Song was not belong to Sơn Tùng M-TP, "Từng Quen" from Wren Evans is the Most Dominant Song with 15 times in the 1st Rank. This is an impressive feat for a young artist like him. Maybe because of this feat, he and tlinh both each got a collaborative song with Apple: "[Cứu lấy âm nhạc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K6PRfAp6O4)" and "[đừng làm nó phức tạp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2oCfQ5QOIk)".
