-Sơn Tùng M-TP is undoubtly the "King of V-pop", because he is the Most Dominant Artist in this platform with 26 times in the First position, he achieved the First position with 7 different songs, "Chúng ta của hiện tại" and "Đừng làm trái tim anh đau" were the 2 hits with 7 times in the No.1 song, and "Chúng ta của hiện tại" also stayed relevant for 194 weeks.

-Even though having multiple hits, the Most Dominant Song was not belong to Sơn Tùng M-TP, "Từng Quen" from Wren Evans is the Most Dominant Song with 15 times in the 1st Rank.
