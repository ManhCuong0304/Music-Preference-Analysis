# Data Analysis Project: Vietnamese Music Preference from 2018 to 2024
## Introduction
A new talent music artist wants to determine whether their music genre appeals to Vietnamese listeners and identify suitable, well-known artists within the same genre for collaboration on their debut album. The Analysis Project will help that artist to understand the overall listener demographic, the best candidate to invite for the collaboration, what platform that the artist's song would perform the best.
## Project Objectives: 
1. Analyze Vietnamese music preferences, including genre distribution and the influence of foreign versus local music.
2. Identify the most dominant artists based on their appearances in the charts across all available platforms.
3. Determine the songs that have held the first position multiple times.
4. Identify potential artists for collaboration, and the best platform to release the song.
## Tools that were used in analysis
1. Python/Visual Studio Code: To get the scripts for collecting raw data.
2. Excel: To store and organize the data.
3. Power BI: To create visualizations for the analysis.
## Skills
1. Knowing how websites are built to scrape data effectively.
2. Writing good prompts to generate the right scripts.
3. Cleaning data and solving problems along the way.
4. Creating clear and impactful visualizations.
5. Making decisions to match requirements based on data.

### a.2. Overall Analysis

Overall, on the Apple Music platform, Vietnamese listeners have gradually shifted their preference from US-UK pop to V-pop. As a result, music by Vietnamese artists has appeared more frequently in the Weekly Rank Chart since 2021.

Sơn Tùng M-TP is undoubtedly the "King of V-pop" as he is the Most Dominant Artist on this platform, reaching the First position 26 times. He achieved this with seven different songs, with Chúng ta của hiện tại and Đừng làm trái tim anh đau being the two biggest hits, each reaching No.1 seven times. Additionally, Chúng ta của hiện tại stayed relevant for 194 weeks.

Even though he has multiple hits, the Most Dominant Song does not belong to Sơn Tùng M-TP. Từng Quen by Wren Evans holds this title, ranking 1st for 15 weeks—an impressive feat for a young artist like him. Perhaps because of this success, both he and tlinh secured collaborations with Apple: "[Cứu lấy âm nhạc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K6PRfAp6O4)" and "[đừng làm nó phức tạp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2oCfQ5QOIk)".  It seems that Apple wanted to position itself as a young and energetic brand, as they actively promoted these two music videos. The Like-to-View ratio for Wren's song is only 0.11%, indicating that while the video was not highly engaging, it was seen by a large audience through advertising.

To identify the perfect candidate for collaboration, an individual analysis is required. Among the top five artists in the Most Dominant Artists chart, three stand out as potential candidates. Sơn Tùng M-TP is primarily known for his solo songs, with his only collaboration being with a foreign artist, while Mono has had just one song reach the top. Therefore, Wren Evans, tlinh, and Đen have been selected for individual analysis.
